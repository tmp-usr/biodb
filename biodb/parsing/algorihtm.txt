1. insert taxdump/names and taxdump/nodes as they are to the tables
    biodb_ncbi and hier_ncbi
2. by using biodb.sqling.selector.Selector get lineages of each species (level = 6)
    a. if a lineage includes all the ranks between 1-6 leave it as it is. 
    b. if a lineage lacks one of the ranks between 1-6, check if sub or super version of the lacking rank exists anywhere in the lineage
    c. identify the unused ranks and delete them, shrink the database more. it is too big in its current version


    c.i. build a database of lineages. check if ids or the names themselves are more efficent!
         (convert balter db to a lineage database of identifiers only instead of the fullnames
          the time consuming step is not finding the names but building the lineages.
          if converting lineages from ids to names is too time consuming stick to the original balter
          idea. do not use fantom.db. migrate totally to balter with a database tables of the names (biodb) and hierarchies (balter) )
